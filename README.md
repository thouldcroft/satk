# The Sound Art Toolkit (SATK)
## Introduction
The Sound Art Toolkit is a collection of high-level Pure Data modules (abstractions) that provide access to common sound generating processes. These tools (attempt) to not lean towards any one specific sound art pratice - in other words, the tools aren't specifically made for, say, making music, but that is not to say that they cannot be used to make music.

These modules primarily were developed to introduce non-coders to the Pure Data and Max coding environments, allowing students to explore the programming elements of these languages while also having high level abstractions to get that code to "do something". Learning how to code can be a challenge, and getting that code to do something interesting is an even greater challenge, and so I felt that giving students a place to start, and allow them to focus on coding was important. This is by no means a revolutionary idea, there are other tools out there, such as the K-12 package in Pdl2ork (http://l2ork.music.vt.edu/main/make-your-own-l2ork/software/) and AUTOMATONISM (https://www.automatonism.com/) for Pd, or BEAP (https://github.com/stretta/BEAP) for Max, and they are WONDERFUL tools, but Pdl2ork is for Linux only, BEAP is Max only and is very specific to Analog synthesis, and AUTOMATONISM relies on its own (very thorough) file structure and GUI, which is wonderful, but pulls the user away from Pd coding a bit. I tried to keep my library as close to standard Pd coding as I could.
